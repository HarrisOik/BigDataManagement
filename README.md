## About:
This is a project that was developed for the Big Data Management course of University of West Attica (UniWA).

The project is a web application style management tool that provides the user access to big data handling and processing technologies like Hadoop MapReduce, Hadoop HDFS, Hadoop YARN, Kafka and Flume, as well as libraries for machine learning like Mahout.
